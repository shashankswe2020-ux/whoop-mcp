# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Hardened OAuth callback responses with security headers (`Cache-Control: no-store`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`).
- Hardened Windows browser launch by adding the `start "" <url>` title guard in `openBrowser()`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **3 Analytical Tools** — `get_weekly_summary`, `compare_periods`, `get_trend` for pre-computed health insights
- **3 Individual Record Lookup Tools** — `get_sleep_by_id`, `get_workout_by_id`, `get_cycle_by_id`
- **4 MCP Resources** — ambient health context (`whoop://v2/user/recovery/latest`, sleep, cycle, profile) with in-memory cache and TTL
- **5 MCP Prompts** — guided conversation starters (`weekly_health_review`, `sleep_analysis`, `recovery_trend`, `workout_recap`, `health_check`)
- **Auto-pagination utility** — `fetchAllPages` with safety caps (500 records, 20 pages max, inter-page delay)
- **Enhanced date handling** — all collection tools accept relative expressions ("today", "last 7 days", "this week", "last month")
- **Statistics utility** — mean, median, std deviation, linear regression, anomaly detection (pure TypeScript, no deps)

### Changed
- Collection tool descriptions updated to document relative date expression support
- Tool count: 6 → 12
- Resource count: 0 → 4
- Prompt count: 0 → 5
- Test count: 217 → 430+

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **OAuth refresh tokens now work** — added `offline` scope to OAuth authorization request, enabling persistent refresh tokens across sessions (thanks [@efdavis](https://github.com/efdavis) — PR #34)
- **Tokens persist across Claude Desktop restarts** — fixed token storage so cached tokens survive server restarts without re-authentication
- **Hardened token validation** — improved shape validation for stored tokens and redacted file paths in log messages to avoid leaking usernames
- **Dropped Node 18.x from CI** — Node 18 reached EOL; CI now tests on Node 20 and 22
- **Fixed IPv6 test failures** — callback server tests now work correctly in IPv6 environments

### Changed
- Formatted all source and test files with Prettier (style-only, no behavior changes)
- 217 tests passing (up from 212)

### Added
- Security audit report #2 (`docs/security-audits/security-audit-2.md`)
- "Get a WHOOP" section in README with referral links

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- `SECURITY.md` — vulnerability reporting process, OAuth/token/API security design, known limitations
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Contributor Covenant v2.1
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions CI pipeline (typecheck, lint, test, coverage, build) on Node 18/20/22

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-12

### Changed
- Added Claude Desktop integration screenshots to README (server connected + live chat)
- Added MCP Inspector testing screenshots to README (OAuth grant flow + `get_profile` result)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **MCP server** with stdio transport for Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients
- **OAuth2 Authorization Code flow** — browser-based authentication with automatic token refresh
- **Secure token storage** at `~/.whoop-mcp/tokens.json` with `0600` file permissions
- **6 MCP tools** for querying WHOOP health and fitness data:
  - `get_profile` — user's basic profile (name, email)
  - `get_body_measurement` — height, weight, max heart rate
  - `get_recovery_collection` — HRV, resting heart rate, SpO2, skin temp
  - `get_sleep_collection` — sleep stages, duration, respiratory rate
  - `get_workout_collection` — strain, heart rate zones, calories, sport type
  - `get_cycle_collection` — physiological cycles with strain and calorie data
- **Resilient error handling:**
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff for rate limits (429)
  - Automatic token refresh on auth failures (401)
  - Clear, user-friendly messages for network errors
  - MCP-formatted error responses (tools never crash the server)
- **CLI entry point** — `npx whoop-mcp` with environment variable configuration
- **202 tests** with full coverage of auth, API client, tools, and error handling
